# Blockchain Voting System README

Welcome to our Blockchain Voting System! This document provides a simple overview to help you get started.

## Features

- **Secure Voting**: Leverage blockchain technology to ensure secure and transparent voting.
- **Smart Contracts**: Use Solidity to implement voting logic.
- **Metamask Integration**: Connect and interact with the blockchain via Metamask.
- **Local Blockchain**: Use Ganache for local blockchain development and testing.
- **Development Tools**: Utilize Truffle for smart contract development and Remix IDE for writing and debugging Solidity code.

## Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following installed:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (version 14.x or higher)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (Node Package Manager)
- [Truffle](https://www.trufflesuite.com/truffle) (version 5.x or higher)
- [Ganache](https://www.trufflesuite.com/ganache)
- [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) (browser extension)

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/blockchain-voting-system.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```sh
    cd blockchain-voting-system
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```sh
    npm install
    ```

## Setting Up

### Ganache

1. Open Ganache and create a new workspace.
2. Note the RPC server address (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:7545`).

### Truffle

1. Compile the smart contracts:
    ```sh
    truffle compile
    ```
2. Migrate the smart contracts to Ganache:
    ```sh
    truffle migrate --network development
    ```

### Metamask

1. Install the Metamask browser extension.
2. Connect Metamask to the local blockchain (Ganache):
    - Open Metamask and click on the network dropdown.
    - Select "Custom RPC" and enter the Ganache RPC server address.
3. Import an account using the private key from Ganache.

## Running the Application

To start the application, run:

```sh
npm start
The application will be accessible at http://localhost:3000.
